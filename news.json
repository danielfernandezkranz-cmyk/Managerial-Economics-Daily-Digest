        "summary": "Fed Chair Powell suggests job growth may be overstated by 60k/month. If the labor market is actually weaker than official data suggests, the 'data-dependent' Fed may be forced to cut rates more aggressively in 2026 to prevent a recession.",

        "question": "If labor market data is systemically overstated (meaning actual employment is lower than reported), how does this affect the 'Output Gap' variable in a standard Taylor Rule, and what is the policy implication?",
        "options": [
            "The positive output gap is larger, implying rates should be higher to cool the economy.",
            "The output gap is actually more negative (or less positive), implying monetary policy is too tight and rates should comprise.",
            "Labor market errors do not affect the Taylor Rule, which only looks at inflation variance."
        ],
        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. The Taylor Rule sets rates based on inflation deviation and the Output Gap (difference between actual and potential GDP/Employment). If employment is overstated, the actual economy is weaker (more negative gap) than thought. This calls for a lower interest rate to stimulate demand."
