        "summary": "Despite recent Fed rate cuts, 10-year Treasury yields have unexpectedly risen. This divergence is largely attributed to market concerns over persistent high government deficits increasing bond supply, and the potential for these deficits to reignite future inflation.",

            "Expectations of increased bond supply due to high deficits, and fears of higher future inflation.",

        "correctOption": 0,
        "explanation": "Correct. Long-term yields are market-determined. If investors expect a flood of new Treasury issuance (increased supply) to fund deficits, or fear that fiscal looseness will lead to inflation, they sell bonds, pushing yields higher."

        "correctOption": 1,

        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. Food and energy prices are volatile and often driven by external supply shocks (e.g., oil wars, bad harvests) that monetary policy cannot control. 'Core' inflation filters these out to reveal the persistent trend that the Fed *can* influence."

        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. The Taylor Rule sets rates based on inflation deviation and the Output Gap (difference between actual and potential GDP/Employment). If employment is overstated, the actual economy is weaker (more negative gap) than thought. This calls for a lower interest rate to stimulate demand."
