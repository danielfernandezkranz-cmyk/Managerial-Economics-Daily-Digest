        "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claims the U.S. economy will end the year with 3% Real GDP growth, citing a 'very strong' holiday season. However, Consumer Sentiment remains low (53.3), highlighting a disconnect between macroeconomic data and household perception.",

        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. GDP measures total output, but doesn't capture cost-of-living pressure directly. If inflation (prices) rose faster than wages for much of the period, households lost purchasing power (Real Wages fell). 'Money Illusion' refers to the confusion between nominal and real values, but the feeling of being squeezed is a real income effect."

        "summary": "Core PCE inflation (the Fed's preferred measure) came in at 2.8% for September, slightly lower than expected. This 'stable' reading, despite tariffs, provides the Federal Reserve with the necessary 'air cover' to proceed with a rate cut next week.",

        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. Food and energy prices are volatile and often driven by external supply shocks (e.g., oil wars, bad harvests) that monetary policy cannot control. 'Core' inflation filters these out to reveal the persistent trend that the Fed *can* influence."

        "summary": "Fed Chair Powell suggests job growth may be overstated by 60k/month. If the labor market is actually weaker than official data suggests, the 'data-dependent' Fed may be forced to cut rates more aggressively in 2026 to prevent a recession.",

        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. The Taylor Rule sets rates based on inflation deviation and the Output Gap (difference between actual and potential GDP/Employment). If employment is overstated, the actual economy is weaker (more negative gap) than thought. This calls for a lower interest rate to stimulate demand."
