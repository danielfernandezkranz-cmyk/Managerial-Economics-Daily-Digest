        "summary": "Fed Chair Powell suggests job growth may be overstated by 60k/month. If the labor market is actually weaker than official data suggests, the 'data-dependent' Fed may be forced to cut rates more aggressively in 2026 to prevent a recession.",

        "question": "If labor market data is systemically overstated (meaning actual employment is lower than reported), how does this affect the 'Output Gap' variable in a standard Taylor Rule, and what is the policy implication?",
        "options": [
            "The positive output gap is larger, implying rates should be higher to cool the economy.",
            "The output gap is actually more negative (or less positive), implying monetary policy is too tight and rates should comprise.",
            "Labor market errors do not affect the Taylor Rule, which only looks at inflation variance."
        ],
        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. The Taylor Rule sets rates based on inflation deviation and the Output Gap (difference between actual and potential GDP/Employment). If employment is overstated, the actual economy is weaker (more negative gap) than thought. This calls for a lower interest rate to stimulate demand."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4.25%-4.5%, marking the sixth cut since September. While inflation measures have improved, the 'dot plot' suggests a slower pace of future cuts than markets previously hoped.",

        "question": "The Fed lowered rates to support the labor market despite inflation being slightly sticky. According to the Phillips Curve short-run trade-off, what is the implicit risk of cutting rates while full employment is high?",
        "options": [
            "It risks causing a liquidity trap where monetary policy becomes ineffective.",
            "It risks re-igniting demand-pull inflation by stimulating aggregate demand too much relative to supply.",
            "It risks increasing the unemployment rate due to the crowding-out effect."
        ],
        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. The Phillips Curve suggests a short-run inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. Cutting rates fuels aggregate demand (consumption and investment). If the economy is already near full employment, this extra demand can push prices up (demand-pull inflation) rather than just increasing output."

        ],
        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. Lower interest rates in the Eurozone (relative to the US) reduce the return on Euro-denominated assets. Investors seeking higher yield sell Euros to buy Dollars, increasing supply of Euros and demand for Dollars, causing the Euro to depreciate."

The new equilibrium is at a lower level of income/output (Y) and a lower interest rate (r), as lower demand for money reduces the 'price' of money."
