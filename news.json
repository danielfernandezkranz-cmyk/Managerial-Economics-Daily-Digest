        "summary": "Core PCE inflation (the Fed's preferred measure) came in at 2.8% for September, slightly lower than expected. This 'stable' reading, despite tariffs, provides the Federal Reserve with the necessary 'air cover' to proceed with a rate cut next week.",

        "question": "The article explicitly distinguishes between 'Headline PCE' and 'Core PCE'. Why does the Federal Reserve prefer 'Core PCE' as a guide for monetary policy?",
        "options": [
            "Because Core PCE includes food and energy prices, which are the most important costs for consumers.",
            "Because Core PCE excludes volatile food and energy prices, providing a better signal of underlying long-term inflation trends.",
            "Because Core PCE is released weekly, whereas Headline PCE is only monthly."
        ],
        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. Food and energy prices are volatile and often driven by external supply shocks (e.g., oil wars, bad harvests) that monetary policy cannot control. 'Core' inflation filters these out to reveal the persistent trend that the Fed *can* influence."

        "summary": "Fed Chair Powell suggests job growth may be overstated by 60k/month. If the labor market is actually weaker than official data suggests, the 'data-dependent' Fed may be forced to cut rates more aggressively in 2026 to prevent a recession.",

        "question": "If labor market data is systemically overstated (meaning actual employment is lower than reported), how does this affect the 'Output Gap' variable in a standard Taylor Rule, and what is the policy implication?",
        "options": [
            "The positive output gap is larger, implying rates should be higher to cool the economy.",
            "The output gap is actually more negative (or less positive), implying monetary policy is too tight and rates should comprise.",
            "Labor market errors do not affect the Taylor Rule, which only looks at inflation variance."
        ],
        "correctOption": 1,
        "explanation": "Correct. The Taylor Rule sets rates based on inflation deviation and the Output Gap (difference between actual and potential GDP/Employment). If employment is overstated, the actual economy is weaker (more negative gap) than thought. This calls for a lower interest rate to stimulate demand."
